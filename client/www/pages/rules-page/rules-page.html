                    The game starts when all the players receive the same number of dice, between 1 to 5, and each
                    player can see only his own dice.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    The round starts when the first player sets his gamble.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    The gamble is defined by two parameters - number of dice and the dice's number.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    An example for a gamble can be 5 times of dice 3, that says, at least 5 times of the dice 3 on the
                    table(for all players together).
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Then, the turn move to the next player.
                    To the next player has two choices:
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    1. To raise the gamble.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    2. To say this is a lie.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    If the player chooses the first option, he can increase the amount of the dice,
                    and to choose any number he wants. If he wants to stay with the current amount of dice,
                    he must to increase the dice's number(It means that if the last gamble was with the dice number 6,
                    the current gamble must increase the amount of the dice).
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    If the player chooses the second option, all the players expose their dice and check if the last
                    gamble was correct.
                </h4>

                <h4>
                    For example, if the last gamble was 5 times of 3, and there are at least 5 times of 3 on the table,
                    so last gamble was correct, and the player that said "It's a lie" lost the round. If there are no
                    at least 5 times of 3,
                    the player who set the last gamble lost the round. The player that lost the round needs to drop a
                    single dice,
                    and that means that in the next round he will be powerless than the other players.
                </h4>

                <h4>
                    The game is ending when just one player holds dice, and of course, this player is the winner of the game.
                </h4>

                <h4>
                    Notice that the dice number 1 is generic dice and when player sets his gamble, it means that we count
                    the number that he gambled and also the number 1.
                    For example, if player sets gamble of 5 times of 3, we count the dice with the number 3, and also the
                    dice with the number 1.
